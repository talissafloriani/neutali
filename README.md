## About

My name is Talissa Floriani and here we will discuss about science in general, science (genetics and plant breeding or any related field), and we will highlight things important to the improvement of a scientific career. 
Ok, but who are you? Well, like I said, my name is Talissa but you can call me Tata, I'm an Agronomist and passionate for plant genetics (specially pulse crops). I got my BSc. in Agronomy from Santa Catarina State University and during my senior year of my undergraduate I went to the University of California Davis (UCD), and now I'm a master student in Genetics and Plant Breeding From the University of São Paulo (ESALQ/USP).
